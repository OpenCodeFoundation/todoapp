## Unit tests

We use xUnit.net for all unit testing.

## Coding guidelines

> The content of the code that we write.

### Coding style guidelines – general

1. Use four spaces of indentation (no tabs)
2. Use `_camelCase` for private fields
3. Avoid `this`. unless absolutely necessary
4. Always specify member visibility, even if it's the default (i.e. `private string _foo;` not `string _foo;`)
Open-braces `({)` go on a new line
5. Use any language features available to you (expression-bodied members, throw expressions, tuples, etc.) as long as they make for readable, manageable code.
    - This is pretty bad: `public (int, string) GetData(string filter) => (Data.Status, Data.GetWithFilter(filter ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(filter))));`


### Usage of the var keyword

The var keyword is to be used as much as the compiler will allow. For example, these are correct:

```csharp
var fruit = "Lychee";
var fruits = new List<Fruit>();
var flavor = fruit.GetFlavor();
string fruit = null; // can't use "var" because the type isn't known (though you could do (string)null, don't!)
const string expectedName = "name"; // can't use "var" with const
```

The following are incorrect:

```csharp
string fruit = "Lychee";
List<Fruit> fruits = new List<Fruit>();
FruitFlavor flavor = fruit.GetFlavor();
```

### Use C# type keywords in favor of .NET type names

When using a type that has a C# keyword the keyword is used in favor of the .NET type name. For example, these are correct:

```csharp
public string TrimString(string s) {
    return string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)
        ? null
        : s.Trim();
}

var intTypeName = nameof(Int32); // can't use C# type keywords with nameof
```

The following are incorrect:

```csharp
public String TrimString(String s) {
    return String.IsNullOrEmpty(s)
        ? null
        : s.Trim();
}
```

## Async method patterns

By default all `async` methods must have the Async suffix. There are some exceptional circumstances where a method name from a previous framework will be grandfathered in.

Passing cancellation tokens is done with an optional parameter with a value of `default(CancellationToken)`, which is equivalent to `CancellationToken.None` (one of the few places that we use optional parameters). The main exception to this is in web scenarios where there is already an `HttpContext` being passed around, in which case the context has its own cancellation token that can be used when needed.

Sample async method:

```csharp
public Task GetDataAsync(
    QueryParams query,
    int maxData,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
    ...
}
```

## Extension method patterns

The general rule is: if a regular static method would suffice, avoid extension methods.

Extension methods are often useful to create chainable method calls, for example, when constructing complex objects, or creating queries.

Internal extension methods are allowed, but bear in mind the previous guideline: ask yourself if an extension method is truly the most appropriate pattern.

The namespace of the extension method class should generally be the namespace that represents the functionality of the extension method, as opposed to the namespace of the target type. One common exception to this is that the namespace for middleware extension methods is normally always the same is the namespace of `IAppBuilder`.

The class name of an extension method container (also known as a "sponsor type") should generally follow the pattern of `<Feature>Extensions`, `<Target><Feature>Extensions`, or `<Feature><Target>Extensions`. For example:

```csharp
namespace Food {
    class Fruit { ... }
}

namespace Fruit.Eating {
    class FruitExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
  OR
    class FruitEatingExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
  OR
    class EatingFruitExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
}
```

When writing extension methods for an interface the sponsor type name must not start with an I.

## Unit tests and functional tests

### Assembly naming

The unit tests for the `Microsoft.Fruit` assembly live in the `Microsoft.Fruit.Tests` assembly.

The functional tests for the `Microsoft.Fruit assembly` live in the `Microsoft.Fruit.FunctionalTests` assembly.

In general there should be exactly one unit test assembly for each product runtime assembly. In general there should be one functional test assembly per repo. Exceptions can be made for both.

### Unit test class naming

Test class names end with Test and live in the same namespace as the class being tested. For example, the unit tests for the `Microsoft.Fruit.Banana` class would be in a `Microsoft.Fruit.BananaTest` class in the test assembly.

### Unit test method naming

Unit test method names must be descriptive about what is being tested, under what conditions, and what the expectations are. Pascal casing and underscores can be used to improve readability. The following test names are correct:

```
PublicApiArgumentsShouldHaveNotNullAnnotation
Public_api_arguments_should_have_not_null_annotation
```

The following test names are incorrect:

```
Test1
Constructor
FormatString
GetData
```

### Unit test structure

The contents of every unit test should be split into three distinct stages, optionally separated by these comments:

```
// Arrange
// Act
// Assert
```

The crucial thing here is that the Act stage is exactly one statement. That one statement is nothing more than a call to the one method that you are trying to test. Keeping that one statement as simple as possible is also very important. For example, this is not ideal:

```csharp
int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(GetComplexParam1(), GetComplexParam2(), GetComplexParam3());
```

This style is not recommended because way too many things can go wrong in this one statement. All the GetComplexParamN() calls can throw for a variety of reasons unrelated to the test itself. It is thus unclear to someone running into a problem why the failure occurred.

The ideal pattern is to move the complex parameter building into the Arrange section:

```csharp
// Arrange
P1 p1 = GetComplexParam1();
P2 p2 = GetComplexParam2();
P3 p3 = GetComplexParam3();

// Act
int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(p1, p2, p3);

// Assert
Assert.AreEqual(1234, result);
```

Now the only reason the line with `CallSomeMethod()` can fail is if the method itself blew up. This is especially important when you're using helpers such as ExceptionHelper, where the delegate you pass into it must fail for exactly one reason.

### Testing exception messages

In general testing the specific exception message in a unit test is important. This ensures that the exact desired exception is what is being tested rather than a different exception of the same type. In order to verify the exact exception it is important to verify the message.

To make writing unit tests easier it is recommended to compare the error message to the RESX resource. However, comparing against a string literal is also permitted.

```csharp
var ex = Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(
    () => fruitBasket.GetBananaById(1234));
Assert.Equal(
    Strings.FormatInvalidBananaID(1234),
    ex.Message);
```

### Use xUnit.net's plethora of built-in assertions

xUnit.net includes many kinds of assertions – please use the most appropriate one for your test. This will make the tests a lot more readable and also allow the test runner report the best possible errors (whether it's local or the CI machine). For example, these are bad:

```csharp
Assert.Equal(true, someBool);

Assert.True("abc123" == someString);

Assert.True(list1.Length == list2.Length);

for (int i = 0; i < list1.Length; i++) {
    Assert.True(
        String.Equals
            list1[i],
            list2[i],
            StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
}

```

These are good:

```csharp
Assert.True(someBool);

Assert.Equal("abc123", someString);

// built-in collection assertions!
Assert.Equal(list1, list2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

### Parallel tests

By default all unit test assemblies should run in parallel mode, which is the default. Unit tests shouldn't depend on any shared state, and so should generally be runnable in parallel. If the tests fail in parallel, the first thing to do is to figure out why; do not just disable parallel tests!

For functional tests it is reasonable to disable parallel tests.
